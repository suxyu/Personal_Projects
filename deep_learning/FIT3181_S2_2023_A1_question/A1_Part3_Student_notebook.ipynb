Below are descriptions of some parameters which you can find in function `__init__()` for the class `BaseImageClassifier`:\n",

All convolutional layers have filter size $(3, 3)$, strides $(1, 1)$ and 'SAME' padding, and all mean pool layers have strides $(2, 2)$ and 'SAME' padding. The network will consists of a few blocks before applying a linear layer to output the logits for the softmax layer.\n",

    "3. `drop_rate`: the keep probability for dropout. Setting `drop_rate` to $0.0$ means not using dropout. \n",
    "4. `batch_norm`: the batch normalization function is used or not. Setting `batch_norm` to `None` means not using batch normalization. \n",
    "5. The `skip connection` is added to the output of the second `batch norm`. Additionally, your class has a boolean property (i.e., instance variable) named `use_skip`. If `use_skip=True`, the skip connectnion is enable. Otherwise, if `use_skip=False`, the skip connectnion is disable.\n",

In this question, we will investigate a recent SOTA technique to improve the generalization ability of deep nets named *Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)* ([link to the main paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6Tm1mposlrM)).  Furthermore, SAM is simple and efficient technique, but roughly doubles the training time due to its required computation. If you have an idea to improve SAM, it would be a great paper to top-tier venues in machine learning and computer vision. Highly recommend to give it a try. "
