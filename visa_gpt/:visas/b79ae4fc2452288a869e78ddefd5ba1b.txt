Want to get to Australia sooner? You can help prevent delays in your visa application. Here are some top tips from the Australian Department of Home Affairs to help get it right the first time. Provide all your information and documents the first time so your visa won’t be held up.
Don’t forget documents need to be translated into English. Make sure you include the translator’s details on the translated document.
Check your name is spelt correctly and it exactly matches your passport. Watch out for auto-correct!
If you’re under 18 you will need to submit extra information. As well as a copy of your own passport and birth certificate, you will need to attach a copy of each of your parent’s passports.
Submit your application well ahead of time. We recommend you book your flight after your visa has been granted.
Many visas to Australia need you to have a health examination. You can get your health examination done before you apply for your visa using the My Health Declarations Service. Search ‘MHD’ on the Department’s website. 
If you’re a student, submit a current Confirmation of Enrolment, known as a COE, with your application. If your course start date has passed, you’ll need to submit an updated COE with the new start date.
When you apply for your visa, make sure you opt-in to receive electronic communication from us. Check your ImmiAccount regularly for updates. This is where we will send you messages – including any requests for further information.
You may receive a request from us in ImmiAccount asking for biometric data, such as a photo and fingerprints. It is important that you get your biometrics collected quickly to avoid any delays with processing your visa application. Get it right the first time for a faster visa process.
