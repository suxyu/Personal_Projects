Page Content​​Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) allows visa holders, employers, education providers and other organisations to check visa details and conditions.VEVO tells you details relating to your current in-effect visa:which visa the expiry datethe must not arrive after datethe period of stay (how long you can stay) conditions (what you can and can't do).VEVO is not able to provide any details relating to visas that are not  ‘in-effect’. For example, if you hold a Bridging visa but your substantive visa  has not yet expired.​


Long term residentsPeople who migrated to Australia before 1990 and have not travelled out of Australia might not have a record in VEVO. You can  apply to have a record created. You can then use VEVO to prove you have a permanent visa.
