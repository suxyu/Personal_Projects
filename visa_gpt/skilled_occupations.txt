Page Content​​​​Processing on-hand visa applications is a government priority. In most instances, we have reduced the time it takes to finalise visa applications. Actions taken to improve processing timesWe have focused resources on visa processing. This includes recruiting new staff.Wherever we can, we aim to streamline the processing of applications without compromising program integrity.These actions have already reduced the number of on-hand visa applications.Improved processing timesVisa processing times have already improved across most visa programs, particularly across temporary visa programs.Some visa programs have a large number of older cases on-hand as well as increasing numbers of new applications. We are working through these as quickly as possible, and are focused on finalising older applications.Processing times are currently impacted by older applications on-hand, but this will improve once we have worked through them.Median processing times for key programsThe information below shows the median visa processing times for key visa categories. This is the most accurate way to show the amount of time it is taking most visa applications to be finalised.Visa processing times vary between different visas within these categories, and in some cases it may take longer for those visas to be finalised.
