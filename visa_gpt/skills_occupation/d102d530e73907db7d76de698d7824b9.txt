We may assess your health as part of the visa application process.Find out information on:

We call this prejudicing accessYou might have to have health examinations to prove you meet the health requirement. A Medical Officer of the Commonwealth (M​OC)​ will assess the results of your examinations. If you have a significant medical condition, the MOC will advise us whether the condition is likely to:

      significant healthcare and community service costsplace a demand on healthcare or community services that are in 
      short supplyThe MOC will consider what kind of services a hypothetical person with the same kind and severity of condition would need. They will advise us on that basis.When the MOC gives us advice they can only consider your medical situation, not your other personal circumstances. For example, the MOC cannot consider whether having private health insurance or enough money to pay for treatment will impact your use of available public services.​The MOC might also recommend we ask you to sign a 
   health undertaking.​​
