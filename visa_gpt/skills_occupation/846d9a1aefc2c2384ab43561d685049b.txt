                    Privacy
                

















Page ContentThe 
   Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act) is concerned with your personal information. The rules governing how we deal with your personal information are contained in a set of Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). Below is a summary of our practices and procedures regarding access to and correction of personal information. Additional information can be found in our 
   privacy policy.The Privacy Act also requires the department to notify an individual of certain matters when we collect personal information about them. 
   Form 1442i is the notification of those matters.The temporary skilled visas data matching program with the ATOThis data matching program has been developed to assist the Department of Home Affairs (incorporating its operational arm, the Australian Border Force) more effectively detect and deal with compliance risks in the temporary skilled visa program. For more information see 
    The temporary skilled visas data matching program with the Australian Taxation Office. Data qualityWe take steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is  accurate, up to date and complete. These steps include correcting personal  information that is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or  misleading when it is reasonable to do so. Regular audits and quality inspections are conducted to ensure the  accuracy and integrity of information is checked regularly and any systemic  data quality issues are identified and resolved promptly.Access to personal information Individuals can access information about themselves in departmental  documents (other than exempt documents) under the 
   Privacy Act 1988 or 
   Freedom  of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act).An individual can seek to obtain original documents or copies of personal  information by approaching us.  The individual will be requested to complete 
   Form 424A Request  for access to documents or information. This will allow us to track and  monitor each request to ensure that we meet our legislative obligations under  the FOI Act or Privacy Act. We have a statutory 30 day period to respond to the request. Corrections of personal information Individuals can seek to amend or annotate their personal information.  How we amend or annotate a record depends on a number of circumstances.Australian citizensAustralian citizens seeking to change their personal information on their  evidence of Australian citizenship such as name or date of birth should apply to 
   Change a citizenship certificate with the required documents and fee in accordance with instructions on the form. ImmiCard holders and changes under FOI and Privacy ActsRequests to change biographic details on an ImmiCard (name or date of birth)  can be made by completing an 
   ImmiCard  amendment request. Applicants will need to attach official documentary  evidence and/or an Australian Government issued Change of Name or Marriage Certificate to support the requested change. We will consider issuing a new ImmiCard with amended biographic details following  assessment of the online request and the evidence provided. The request might be  referred to a case manager for an identity assessment as part of the visa  process. Non Australian citizens (permanent and temporary visa holders) with  supporting documentationWhere an individual has official documentation in support of an amendment or  correction, such as a passport or Australian Government issued Change of Name  or Marriage Certificate, they should submit their request in writing using 
   
Form  1022 - Notification of Change in Circumstance or 

Form 1023 -  Notification of Incorrect Answers. The form can be submitted through an  IMMIaccount or sent to the nearest departmental office together with high-resolution  scans (600dpi) of certified documentary evidence to support the identity  change. The change can be actioned by the authorised case officer or relevant  visa processing area.Where the change is not supported by documented evidenceWhere an individual’s request is not supported by official documentary  evidence, and a decision is made under the Privacy Act to refuse access, the  individual can apply under the FOI Act to amend or annotate their personal  records.  A decision to refuse amendment under the Privacy Act must  include the reasons for refusal and the individual should be advised that they  can complete 
   Form 424C  - Request for amendment or annotation to personal records and  submit it to us for a decision under the FOI Act. They should also be advised  that obtaining documentary evidence is highly recommended. Under the legislation that governs it, we do not have any power to ‘create’ a  new identity, including where a person chooses to change their name.   Under Australian law, the State and Territory Registrars of Births,  Deaths and Marriages (RBDM) are the responsible authorities for preferred name  changes.Privacy Impact Assessment RegisterIn accordance with s 15(1) of the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code (the Privacy Code), the Department is required to maintain a
